    "- Download [this](homework.Rmd) notebook and write your solutions inside it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add the notebook with your solutions to your allocated GitHub repo. (Remember to commit and push.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- To solve the tasks, finish the code skeletons provided.\n",
    "  **The code must be runnable to get full points**.\n",

    "- Each task is independent but subtasks are linked.\n",

    "- To **pass the homework**, you need **3 / 6** points.\n",

    "- Remember to run the tests for each function you'll be completing.\n",

    "you can trust these parts in \"downstream\" (more complex) applications.\n",

    "* Always restart R (*Session* > *Restart R*) and rerun the notebook\n",
    "from the top to double-check (i.e. reproduce) your solutions. \n",
    "To make sure you get a clean session, prevent RStudio from loading the previous workspace: \n",
    "*Tools > Global options*, then in the General tab disable \"Restore .RData into workspace at startup\",\n",
    "and for \"Save workspace to .RData on exit\" select \"Never\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* Remember that R starts indexing vectors at position `1`. \n",
    "Many other languages in which these algorithms are implemented start at `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the code doesn't behave the way you want or you get errors,\n",
    "try checking out the chapter on [debugging](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/debugging.html) \n",
    "from *Advanced R* for different approaches to deal with this.\n",
