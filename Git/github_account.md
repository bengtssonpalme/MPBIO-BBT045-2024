## Why github?

Remote repositories is a great way to store and share your codes with your friends and colleagues.
There are a few services that will host your repositories, among the most popular services is [GitHub](https://github.com) and [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org). For this course we want you to use GitHub as it has a large community that we think will benefit you the most after this course.  

## Creating an account.

Click the [link](https://github.com) and sign up for an account. You will be needing an email address to create your account. we recommend to use your private email instead of your school email, so that you do not loose access to your account when you finish school.

## Set your email to private.

To avoid having your email displayed publicly you should make sure you have the right privacy option set. When logged in navigate to settings/emails and check that the option "Keep my email addresses privet" is ticked.
