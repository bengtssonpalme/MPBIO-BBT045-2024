    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Jupyter Notebook and write the Python code that solves the tasks below. Work on Vera, since that's where the data files are located. This homework is due on **Wednesday, February 5, 2025**. Please submit the Jupyter Notebook file on Canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "To **pass the homework** you need **5 points**. The tasks are meant to be rather independent (and a few have subtasks).\n",
    "\n",
    "**To get full points**, please:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`[1 pt]`** Describe what the code is doing. Even if you find solutions online, it's important that you understand what's going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`[1 pt]`** **Make sure your notebook can be run from top to bottom** (i.e. is reproducible). To check, restart the Python 3 kernel to get a fresh session and re-run all cells (in Jupyter Lab: \"Kernel\" â†’ \"Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...\"). This is **crucial** because as you work, various variables will accumulate in the session and this can \"sabotage\" your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus point**: Write code that is understandable! I won't mind not choosing the best possible names for variables but try to inform the reader what's going on by naming things in a clear way. So use something like `reference_genome_df` rather than simply `df` or `x`. This is also a service to future you! \n",

    "## Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remember to always inspect both the input data, as well as intermediate results\n",
    "- We try to point to relevant sources of information, but using the Internet and biological databases is a skill in and of itself, so if the contents of certain biological files are confusing, try to find information about the formats. Most databases have these described somewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, a preliminary module loading section is provided below. These are all necessary to run the example codes provided to you throughout this homework. However, you are more than welcome to use other modules to solve the tasks, if you wish. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to download this notebook, you can do so [here](homework_python_intro.ipynb). If you are on the server, you can use `wget https://bengtssonpalme.github.io/MPBIO-BBT045-2025/python_for_data_analysis/homework_python_intro.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to complete the homework, you will need to copy the following files from your `unix_tutorial/` directory: \n",
    " - `S288C_reference_sequence_R64-5-1_20240529.fsa`\n",
    " - `saccharomyces_cerevisiae_R64-5-1_20240529.gff`\n",
    " - `Y55_JRIF00000000_SGD_cds.fsa`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are ready to start the Homework, launch JupyterLab the same way you did for the Tutorial, with the custom `Python-Intro-HW.sh` script in the `~/portal/jupyter/` directory selected as your Runtime on the Vera OnDemand portal."
