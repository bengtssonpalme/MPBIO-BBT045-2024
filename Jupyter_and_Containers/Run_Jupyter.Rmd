# Start Jupyter Lab session from server

To initiate a Jupyter Lab session on the cluster, follow these steps:

## Log in to the Cluster
Begin by logging into the cluster using the following command, replacing <cid> with your user ID:

`ssh <cid>@vera1.c3se.chalmers.se`

## 2. Copy the Jupyter Lab Script
Copy the run_jupyter.sh script to your desired working directory using the cp command. Adjust <your_directory> accordingly.

`cp /cephyr/NOBACKUP/groups/bbt045_2024/Container/run_jupyter.sh ./<your_directory>`

## 3. Edit Script Parameters

Open the run_jupyter.sh file and edit the lines:

`ID=0                 # Replace 0 with your ID number`\
`TIME=00:20:00        # Adjust the time requirements as needed`

## 4. Run the Script
Execute the edited script to allocate resources on the cluster.

`./run_jupyter.sh`

## 5. Note Your Assigned Node and Port

After a brief moment, you will be allocated resources. Take note of the assigned node and port from the displayed information.

`ssh -N -L <port>:<node_name>:<port> <cid>@vera1.c3se.chalmers.se`. 

In our example:
`ssh -N -L 2000:vera41-3:2000 <cid>@vera1.c3se.chalmers.se`.  

## 7. Open Jupyter Lab in Your Browser
Paste the provided link in your browser to access the Jupyter Lab session.
